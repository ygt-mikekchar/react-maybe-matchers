    <h1>React Maybe Matchers for Jasmine</h1>
      Tests using the React test utilities directly are both difficult to read
      and inconvenient to type. These matchers are intended to to make it
      easier to write tests and to understand what they are doing later.

      Please see the 
      <a href="https://github.com/ygt-mikekchar/react-maybe-matchers">project page</a>
      or browse the
      <a href="https://github.com/ygt-mikekchar/react-maybe-matchers/blob/master/src/ReactMaybeMatchers.litcoffee#react-maybe-matchers-for-jasmine">annotated source code</a>
      for more information of how to use the matchers.

    <h2>Tests</h2>
      You can <a href="spec/index.html">run the tests</a>.
